# roman-numeral-service

NOTE: THE BULK OF THIS SOUURCE CODE IS IN THE FEATURE BRANCH

Instructions:
Please show us how you work by taking this as far as it's fun to do so (subject to the time/capacity you have around your daily commitments). From the exercise, we want to understand your process, and you've some options on how to do that:

    Use your commits to showcase your process, e.g. one commit for each test you add and another commit for each change to the code;
    OR Screen record your exercise and commit as you would normally.

We'd like to see this in Java (or Kotlin) for backend development.

So, create a project on a publicly hosted git repository (e.g. github) and implement:

    With any integer, show the roman numeral;
    With any roman numeral, show the integer.
